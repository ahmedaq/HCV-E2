## Overview
This software package comprises scripts that include the main functions for reproducing the results presented in the paper titled "Identifying immunologically-vulnerable regions of the HCV E2 glycoprotein and broadly neutralizing antibodies that target them".


## Details
#### Title of paper
Identifying immunologically-vulnerable regions of the HCV E2 glycoprotein and broadly neutralizing antibodies that target them
#### Authors
Ahmed A. Quadeer, Raymond H. Y. Louie, and Matthew R. McKay

## Requirements

    * Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
    * Curve Fitting Toolbox
    * Parallel Computing Toolbox
    * MATLAB Distributed Computing Server
    * MATLAB supported compiler installed for compiling C files
 
2.  For inferring maximum-entropy model parameters:
    * Minimum probability flow method (MPF-BML), available at https://github.com/raymondlouie/MPF-BML 
 
3.  For mapping fitness costs on the available E2 crystal structure
    * Pymol, available at https://pymol.org/ 

## Usage
1.  Open MATLAB
2.  Run the script main.m
